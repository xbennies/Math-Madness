# Math-Madness
Hi! I'm Bennie, creator of Math Madness. I'm new to Python, and am creating a project that will utilize most things I learn about Python as time progresses, which is Math Madness! This is just a basic math quiz, which may become more complex as time progresses. Otherwise, not much to see here!

Contact me on Discord (bennie#1123) if you have any questions or wish to contribute in any way.

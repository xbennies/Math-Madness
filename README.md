# Math-Madness

(This project is old and was created when I was new to Python. I don't plan on updating it anytime soon.)

Hi! I'm Bennie, creator of Math Madness. I'm new to Python, and am creating a project that will utilize most things I learn about Python as time progresses, which is Math Madness! This is just a basic math quiz, which may become more complex as time progresses. Otherwise, not much to see here!

Contact me on Discord (@xbennies) if you have any questions or wish to contribute in any way.
